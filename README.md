# Vue JS Lesson Planning

**

**Notes**

:**
The folders are properly listed, but this is an incomplete lesson plan guide for the course. If you are in my class, consider these experimental and the content may change at any time. There are no guarantees that we will get to this during the course.

Nevertheless, this is a foundation step for the second year IET pathway course. 

One of the benefits of Vue JS is an auto update of the DOM without the page being reloaded to reflect new changes.

Part 1
---

 - Declarative rendering with a Hello World example
 
Part 2
---

 - Using v-bind to demonstrate special reactive behavior.

Part 3
---

 - Conditionals using v-if

Part 4
---

 - Using v-for to show lists.
 - Experiment using pop and push in the console. For example,  typing `app4.todos.push({text : 'new item'})` in the console window.

Part 5
---

 - User input using v-on.
 - This particular function uses an object constructor to split the message, reverse it, and rejoin the letter together from back to front.

Part 6
---

 - Using v-model.
 - Whenever the text in the input field is changed, the paragraph element is also changed to instantly reflect what is shown.
